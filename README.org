#+TITLE: hexgrid

* hexgrid project

a simulation and realtime monitor / interface to spatial
structures. the structure is defined as a mesh which can be rendered
and also serve as a structure to organize computing modules with
spatial properties.

* requirements
 - liblo osc
 - pyopengl
 - pygame
 - trimesh
 - numpy, scipy, ...

* modules
 - oscsrv
 - sensorimotor

* running scripts

go into the project directory

: cd smp_meshgrid

** trigrid_display

run the GL display with
: python3 scripts/trigrid_display.py --width=1600 --height=900

** trigrid

this is the model, loading a mesh and sending vertex, edge and face information to the display server

run the model with

: python3 scripts/trigrid.py

*** trigrid modes

there is a few predfined meshes (hexagon, line, ...). the model can
run on its own and it can be connected with the physical hexagon using
libsensorimotor

then there are a few modes that serve as simple demo and starting
points for extending the activation and coupling rules.

 - threshold crossing triggered activation with lateral coupled neighbors
 - TODO: random activation and isotropic propagation
 - TODO: liquid model
